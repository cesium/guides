# Guides

A set of patterns and standards to complement the rules and presets for the
linting and formatting tools used in our projects.

The aim is to facilitate working together by following good practices that
everyone can agree on.

### High level guidelines

- Be consistent.
- Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
- Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
- A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

### A note on the language

- "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
- "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
- "Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
- "Use" is a positive instruction.
