# Elixir

- Avoid macros.
- Prefer pattern matching and guards in function definitions over conditionals
  in the function body.
- Order the dependencies of a module as: `use`, `import`, `alias`.
- Put an empty line between each type of dependency.
- Sort the dependencies in each section alphabetically.
